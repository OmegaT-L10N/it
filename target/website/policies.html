  <h3>License</h3>

  <p>OmegaT is distributed under the GPL v3 license agreement.</p>

  <p>Basically, that means that you have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the freedom to use the software for any purpose,</li>
    <li>the freedom to change the software to suit your needs,</li>
    <li>the freedom to share the software with your friends and neighbors, and</li>
    <li>the freedom to share the changes you make.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These 4 items are a good summary but you can also read the <a
      href="https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/code/ci/master/tree/release/OmegaT-license.txt">whole license</a>.</p>

  <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

  <p>OmegaT does not collect any user information and does not transmit any information without the explicit consent
    of the user.</p>

  <p>The user or their project manager can set OmegaT to use online services. In that case, OmegaT shares information
    with online services:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Access to machine translation services</li>
    <li>Access to team projects</li>
  </ul>

  <p>OmegaT automatically checks the availability of newer versions on its development server without transmitting any user information, and the user can easily opt
    out in the Preferences settings.</p>

  <p>If you find through your analysis that OmegaT communicates with an online service that you have not set, that would
    be a
    bug and we would ask you to report it.</p>

  <p>The translatable data (ie. the files you are translating) are accessed to display the translatable contents to the
    user.</p>

  <p>The translated data is stored in a file called project_save.tmx located in the omegat/ folder of any translation
    project.
    That file is compliant with the TMX specification, which is a standard used by most tools of the same category.</p>

  <p>OmegaT does not store your information online (this is not a "cloud-based" product).</p>

  <h3>Cookies</h3>

  <p>Our website only uses cookies that are strictly necessary cookies for its operation.</p>
