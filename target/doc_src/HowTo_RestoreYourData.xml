	  <listitem><para>When you open a project, OmegaT backs-up <filename>project_save.tmx</filename> into a timestamped backup file.</para>
	  <para>OmegaT keeps up to 10 of those files.</para>
	  <note><para>The backup filename follows the pattern <filename>project_save.tmx.YYYYMMDDhhmm.bak</filename> where <code>YYYY</code>

	  <para>Every time <filename>project_save.tmx</filename> has been modified: either after using <link linkend="menus.project.save" endterm="menus.project.save.title"/>, or as a regular backup every 3 minutes by default, OmegaT creates a backup with the name <filename>project_save.tmx.bak</filename>.

	<title id="how.to.restore.your.data.lost.in.translation.title">You lost your translation?</title>
	<para>If you believe that you have lost translation data, it might probably be safely stored in your most recent backup memory, which is usually less than a few minutes old or so.</para>

	<para>Proceed as follows:
	<orderedlist>
      <listitem>
		<para>Close the project, preventing on any modification on the current status of the backup files.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
		<para>Rename the current <filename>project_save.tmx </filename>file (to
		<filename>project_save.tmx.tmp</filename>, for example).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
		<para>Select the backup translation memory most likely to contain the data
		you are looking for.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
		<para>Rename it <filename>project_save.tmx</filename>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
		<para>Reopen the project.</para>
      </listitem>
	</orderedlist>
	</para>

	<para>This action will restore the status of the translation to the moment on which the selected backup was created. You may repeat this operation as needed for locating older situations. Keep an eye on safely storing all the different files you are renaming for eventual reuse. Also remember not modifying the project configuration or adding TMX files on the meantime, as that may affect the results.</para>

	<para>In rare cases where your computer freezes and OmegaT does not have the time to properly close, some important files can be broken and keep your project from reopening after you have rebooted your machine.</para>

	<para>Proceed as follows:
	<orderedlist>
      <listitem>
		<para>Create a new project with the same settings.</para>
      </listitem>

	  <listitem>
		<para>Copy the contents of the various user folders to their equivalent in the new project (source files, reference translation memory files, glossary files).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
		<para>In the old project, select the translation memory (backup or not) most likely
		to contain the data you are looking for.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>

      <listitem>
		<para>Open the new project the project.</para>
      </listitem>

	<title id="how.to.restore.your.data.translated.file.broken.title">Your translated file won't open?</title>
	<para>Very often, office suite files contain tags that must be copied into the translation to ensure that the translated file can be opened in the original application. In some cases, missing tags will keep the file from opening.</para>
	
	<para>Proceed as follows:
	<orderedlist>
      <listitem>
		<para>Open the project in OmegaT.</para>
      </listitem>

	  <listitem>
		<para>Use <link linkend="menus.tools.check.issues" endterm="menus.tools.check.issues.title"/> and focus on <guilabel>Tag issues</guilabel> .</para>

      <listitem>

      <listitem>
		<para>Open the documents again in the original application.</para>
      </listitem>
	</orderedlist>
	</para>

	<para>This action will fix the internal tag consistency issues that might have been induced by not properly inserting the tags in the translation while in OmegaT.</para>
